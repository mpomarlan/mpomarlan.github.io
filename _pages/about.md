International Workshop on Ontologies for Autonomous Robotics (ROBONTICS 2020) @ Bolzano Summer of Knowledge (BOSK 2020), September 13, Bolzano, Italy
https://robontics2020.github.io


**WORKSHOP SCOPE AND AIM**

ROBONTICS 2020 is the first edition of a workshop aimed at providing a platform to disseminate research into robot autonomy enabled by knowledge-driven approaches, and in particular formal ontologies. Its purpose is to foster communication between the fields of robotics, ontology, and knowledge representation and reasoning, to match open problems to promising approaches, and to review progress in knowledge-driven robotics.

Ontologies are a well-established technique for knowledge representation and management. They formalize conceptualizations at a symbolic, communicable level, allowing re-use of knowledge items between different modules or even agents, as well as explaining reasoning-based decisions. Ontologies have already seen use in robotics, and standardization efforts for robotics knowledge management are in progress. 

Nevertheless, many hard problems remain in robotics, especially involving autonomous robotic agents operating in natural or human environments. Many research projects, motivated by applications in healthcare assistance, logistics, autonomous driving etc, aim to bring robots out of the lab and into realistic human environments. One of the difficulties frustrating such efforts is the large amount of real-world knowledge that an agent needs to have to be able to act competently and autonomously. Further, any item of knowledge is often relevant for many agents and behaviors, and as such should be reusable. To garner trust and enable debugging, knowledge should also be accessible to human operators, both in terms of explaining what knowledge is present in a system, as well as providing ways to easily amend it if necessary.

It would then seem there are still application areas to explore in robotics, and in particular autonomous robotics, for knowledge-enabled and formalized knowledge representation approaches. We are at a point where we can look at previous applications of ontology engineering in robotics to glean lessons from experience, and to consider new knowledge representation and reasoning approaches for new, and even harder problems.


**IMPORTANT DATES**

- Submission deadline: May 31, 2020
- Review notification: June 30, 2020
- Camera ready: July 17, 2020
- Workshop: September 13 (half day)


**LIST OF TOPICS**

Participants are invited to submit original short papers (from 4 to 6 pages + references) for oral presentation, on topics such as:

- Robustness:
	- how can we make robots cope with the variety and relatively fluid structure of human environments?
- Normed behavior:
	- how can one represent, and act according to, norms on behavior such as cultural expectations?
	- how can these expectations be acquired, and would they be the same for robots as they are for humans?
- Explainability:
	- decision chains are very complex; how can these be organized and presented at various levels of detail for the benefit of a human user?
	- what is a good explanation, and how can one generate it?
- Interactivity:
	- how can knowledge about other agents present in the environment be modelled?
	- how can one model the flow of an interaction, such as a conversation or shared task?
